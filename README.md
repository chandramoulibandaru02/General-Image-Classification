# General-Image-Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images into multiple categories. The model was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and achieved high accuracy. The trained model is saved and can be used later for real-time or batch image classification tasks.
